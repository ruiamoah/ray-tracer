HOW TO RUN RAYTRACER

1) POWERSHELL
    Open powershell and then in Release is where the exe is then to run 
    you go .\raytracer.exe then in the next line you enter the text file
    then open ppm file with GIMP or any program that can open it

PS C:\Users\Rui_A> cd .\Desktop\
PS C:\Users\Rui_A\Desktop> cd .\Release\
PS C:\Users\Rui_A\Desktop\Release> .\raytracer.exe
testParsing.txt
Saving image testParsing.ppm: 600 x 600
PS C:\Users\Rui_A\Desktop\Release>

2) FILE EXPLORER
    You can run the exe by clicking the exe then enter text file
    then open ppm file with GIMP or any program that can open it


Both options I tested on 2 different windows 10 machine 

I ran all the test cases and they look similar to the key image and runtime is less then 5 sec on most cases
